#### 1. Coins vs Tokens
A coin is a unit of cryptocurrency associated with a given blockchain network. A token is usually more like a share in a company, it's tradable, sellable, you own it, but it can also be seen as a proof of an ownership stake in something and that thing is what has value.So, the value of the token is extrinsic to it and that is in contrast to the value intrinsic to a coin.
or example, on the Ethereum blockchain, you might buy tokens with your Ether, but you wouldn't buy Ether with your tokens, you would sell your tokens for Ether. Tokens can be created arbitrarily on the Ethereum network. If you have a project, you could invent a token and sell it to fund raise. The value of your token is associated to whatever is behind it, whatever it represents.
