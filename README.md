## Getting started
1. Use the ``` truffle unbox pet-shop ``` as the template
2. Write the contract inside the /Contracts folder (.sol as extension). Use the remix ide to test out the out
3. Inside the /Migrations folder, write the migration code (.js as extension)

     With this the bc part would be over


4. Inside the /src folder, edit the index.html and js/app.js folder, to create the front end
5. Open the ganache network and connect it with metamask
6. Run the ``` npm run dev ``` cmd to run the project
